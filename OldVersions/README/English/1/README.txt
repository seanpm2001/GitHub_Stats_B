[![GitHub Metrics (Lowlighter) daily run for @seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_B/actions/workflows/github-stats-b.yml/badge.svg?branch=GitHub_Stats_B_Main-dev)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_B/actions/workflows/github-stats-b.yml)

# GitHub Stats B

`:octocat: 📊️📈️🗃️ My tertiary GitHub statistics repository, with daily stats generation generated from the @lowlighter source repository.`

***

## Upstream repository

The repository that this repository relies on is located here: [:octocat: `lowlighter/metrics`](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/)

***

## GitHub Stats A

This project is not meant to replace [:octocat: `GitHub_Stats_A`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_A/) it is meant to supplement it. This project has been in planning for a few days, and was previously under consideration for a few months. I am still not entirely sure if it is going to work as intended. GitHub Stats A isn't going anywhere anytime soon regardless.

***

## Problems

During the first night, I consistently had problems getting the workflow configured properly. Close to midnight, I got it to run, but as of 5:26 pm PST the next day, I am consistently running into an error regarding an access token. I have tried creating classic and fine grained access tokens with 2 different names for each type (`METRICS_TOKEN` and `metrics`) and copied the key to the secrets tab (which is named `METRICS_TOKEN`) each time. Yet I am consistently met with the same error:

```
You must provide a valid GitHub personal token to gather your metrics (see https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/.github/readme/partials/documentation/setup/action.md for more informations)
```

I have made 7 variants of the action as well, every version so far has not gotten to or past this point.

***

## TODO

- [ ] Add time zone parameter
- [ ] Add documentation from the upstream repository

***

## Workflow order

Version 1, changes may need to be made (entries re-arranged, added, or possibly removed)
