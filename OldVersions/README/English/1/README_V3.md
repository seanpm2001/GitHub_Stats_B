## Upstream repository

## GitHub Stats A

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

This project is not meant to replace [:octocat: `GitHub_Stats_A`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Stats_A/) it is meant to supplement it. This project has been in planning for a few days, and was previously under consideration for a few months. I am still not entirely sure if it is going to work as intended. GitHub Stats A isn't going anywhere anytime soon regardless.

## Problems

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

During the first night, I consistently had problems getting the workflow configured properly. Close to midnight, I got it to run, but as of 5:26 pm PST the next day, I am consistently running into an error regarding an access token. I have tried creating classic and fine grained access tokens with 2 different names for each type (`METRICS_TOKEN` and `metrics`) and copied the key to the secrets tab (which is named `METRICS_TOKEN`) each time. Yet I am consistently met with the same error:

```
You must provide a valid GitHub personal token to gather your metrics (see https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/.github/readme/partials/documentation/setup/action.md for more informations)
```

I have made 7 variants of the action as well, every version so far has not gotten to or past this point.

Update: I have gotten it to work, the action had some errors that needed to be fixed. I am now trying to see what will and won't run. I will have to see tomorrow.

## Workflow order

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Version 2, changes may need to be made (entries re-arranged, added, or possibly removed)

Version 2 hopes to put less demanding tasks first, and more demanding tasks later.
